          <p>Family is where you learn your first life lessons. Your family members are the only assets that will always be with you. Whatever the circumstances, family members are always there to support one another. In a family, good values and morals are always instilled. We are prepared in the family to respect our elders and love our children. Our family consistently teaches us lessons about honesty, dependability, kindness, and so on. Family always gives us the feeling of being loved and cared for.</p>
